        <!--Explain the rules of the game-->
        <p id="swindlestone_rules">
          Each player has a set number of dice each which they secretly roll and look at.
          They take it in turns to make increasingly high bets about how many dice of a certain roll are on the table altogether.
          One player calls the other out on a bluff and confirms which dice are really on the table.
          The one who was wrong must remove one of their dice, and the loser is the one who is eventually left with no dice at all.
